It covers front end development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then it moves to back end development tools like Node, SQL, and TypeScript. You can code along at home and build a variety of projects while getting exposed to a ton of concepts. (47 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/become-a-full-stack-developer-with-one-video/\\n\\n2. We also just completed work on this new Go programming course where you build your own movie streaming app. Go is a fast back end language, and here we're pairing it with the Gin-Gonic web server framework. As you build this project, you'll also integrate your movie database with OpenAI's API to analyze data and give your users personalized movie recommendations. (15 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-full-stack-movie-streaming-app-with-go-react-mongodb-openai/\\n\\n3. On this week's podcast I interview the self-taught developer who built freeCodeCamp's relational database curriculum, and is now designing our daily coding challenges. Tom Mondloch shares how he finished community college and wasn't sure what to do next. So he spent the next few years working odd jobs in the great outdoors. He used freeCodeCamp to learn modern development tools and started contributing to open source projects. He shares tips for brushing up on your skills after you've taken a long break from programming. (1 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lone-wolf-dev-turned-open-source-super-contributor-tom-mondloch-podcast-190/\\n\\n4. When browsing the web, you may see the error message that something has been “blocked by CORS policy.” CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. When fetching data, if the domain of the requester is different from the domain of the receiver, your browser will reject that request. It's an important security measure, but it can also be a headache for developers trying to maintain their web apps. Luckily, freeCodeCamp just published this tutorial – chock full of theory and code examples – to help you understand the basics. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-fix-cross-origin-errors/\\n\\n5. You've probably heard people throw around terms like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Generative AI. But what do they mean in relation to one another? This quick article breaks down the jargon for you in plain English. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-generative-ai/\\n\\nI'm proud of the freeCodeCamp community and all these open source learning resources we're building.

But after a career-ending injury, he dropped out and moved back in with his parents. While working at an optometry office, he used freeCodeCamp to learn programming. We talk about how he was able to land his first developer job after only 20 carefully-researched applications. He also shares tips for making your network and your skillset more layoff-resilient.

It covers front end development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then it moves to back end development tools like Node, SQL, and TypeScript. You can code along at home and build a variety of projects while getting exposed to a ton of concepts. (47 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/become-a-full-stack-developer-with-one-video/\\n\\n2. We also just completed work on this new Go programming course where you build your own movie streaming app. Go is a fast back end language, and here we're pairing it with the Gin-Gonic web server framework. As you build this project, you'll also integrate your movie database with OpenAI's API to analyze data and give your users personalized movie recommendations. (15 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-full-stack-movie-streaming-app-with-go-react-mongodb-openai/\\n\\n3. On this week's podcast I interview the self-taught developer who built freeCodeCamp's relational database curriculum, and is now designing our daily coding challenges. Tom Mondloch shares how he finished community college and wasn't sure what to do next. So he spent the next few years working odd jobs in the great outdoors. He used freeCodeCamp to learn modern development tools and started contributing to open source projects. He shares tips for brushing up on your skills after you've taken a long break from programming.

When browsing the web, you may see the error message that something has been “blocked by CORS policy.” CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. When fetching data, if the domain of the requester is different from the domain of the receiver, your browser will reject that request. It's an important security measure, but it can also be a headache for developers trying to maintain their web apps. Luckily, freeCodeCamp just published this tutorial – chock full of theory and code examples – to help you understand the basics. (20 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-fix-cross-origin-errors/\\n\\n5. You've probably heard people throw around terms like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Generative AI. But what do they mean in relation to one another? This quick article breaks down the jargon for you in plain English. (10 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-generative-ai/\\n\\nI'm proud of the freeCodeCamp community and all these open source learning resources we're building. If you're proud of it too, then please consider joining the 10,881 kind folks who support our charity and our mission: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate\\n\\nQuote of the Week: \\n“Just start. Find an open source repo. Find an issue. Even if it’s just a typo. Fix it and move on from there.

(49 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/master-technical-interviews-by-learning-data-structures-and-algorithms/\\n\\n2. freeCodeCamp also published a handbook that will teach you React for beginners. React is a powerful front end development library that tons of companies use to make their websites more interactive. If you already know some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this handbook is for you. You'll learn about JSX, components, event handlers, hooks, and more.

On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast: from injured athlete to self-taught software engineer. I interview Kaleb Garner who earned a university scholarship to play baseball. But after a career-ending injury, he dropped out and moved back in with his parents. While working at an optometry office, he used freeCodeCamp to learn programming. We talk about how he was able to land his first developer job after only 20 carefully-researched applications. He also shares tips for making your network and your skillset more layoff-resilient.
